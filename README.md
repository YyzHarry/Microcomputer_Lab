# Microcomputer Lab

## Introduction
This is my code for ___Experiments on Microcomputer and Interface Technology___ Course, EE, Peking University.

Implemented mostly by __C51__, some by __Assembly__.

## Index
1. Usage of MCS-51, by _Assembly_.
2. Timer and Counter.
3. Keyboard.
4. AD & DA.
5. Serial.
6. SPI Bus.
7. I2C Bus.
8. Character-type LCD Module.

These are all of the __Module Experiment__.

## Final Project
The final project realizes an elevator control system. It has graphic interface based on TFT, can record Beep tone using SPI Flash and XRAM.
Also, LED, Lcd1602, AD/DA and keyboard are used.

For more information, you can see __README.md__ in folder "Final Project".

## Environment
Locally tested by ___Keil___. ___C8051F020___ is the chip we use.
